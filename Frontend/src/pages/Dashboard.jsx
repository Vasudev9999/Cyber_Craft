        Our latest project entails building a real-time docker based web
          application featuring login and signup functionalities, crafted using
          docker, git, PHP, HTML, CSS, and SQL. To ensure seamless deployment
          and scalability, we’ve leveraged Docker technology to containerize the
          application. This involved creating distinct images for the frontend
          and backend components. To orchestrate these containers effectively,
          Docker Compose was employed, facilitating their build and runtime
          configurations. Networking capabilities within Docker were utilized to
          establish communication between the frontend and backend containers,
          enabling full-stack functionality. Additionally, we implemented volume
          management to facilitate regular backups of the SQL tabular database,
          ensuring data integrity and resilience. In terms of version control
          and collaboration, we’ve adopted Git and GitHub as our source control
          management platform. Following established branching strategies,
          including development, pre-production, production, and main branches,

          application featuring login and signup functionalities, crafted using
          docker, git, PHP, HTML, CSS, and SQL. To ensure seamless deployment
          and scalability, we’ve leveraged Docker technology to containerize the
          application. This involved creating distinct images for the frontend
          and backend components. To orchestrate these containers effectively,
          Docker Compose was employed, facilitating their build and runtime
          configurations. Networking capabilities within Docker were utilized to
          establish communication between the frontend and backend containers,
          enabling full-stack functionality. Additionally, we implemented volume
          management to facilitate regular backups of the SQL tabular database,
          ensuring data integrity and resilience. In terms of version control
          and collaboration, we’ve adopted Git and GitHub as our source control
          management platform. Following established branching strategies,
